# Shortify

#### Most of the Project & Readme was Built by ChatGPT I just prompted and fixed it.

## Why I Made this

I was hard to find unique username and some then I remembered about A16Z Podcast then from that I got idea to use usernames in this pattern but then calculating usernames was becoming a hassle so I build this.

And I wasted probably to much time on UI.
